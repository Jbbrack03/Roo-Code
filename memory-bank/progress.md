# Progress

## Completed
- Initial LM Studio provider implementation
- Base context window tracking structure
- Implementation of token counting core functionality
- WebAssembly loading mechanism for tiktoken
- Extension context passing to both workers and webview
- Error resilient fallback for token counting
- Permission fixes for WebAssembly files

## In Progress
- Verification of context window accuracy during generation
- Testing of WebAssembly loading in production environment

## Next Tasks
- Update context window UI more frequently during generation
- Add smooth progress indicators for generation percentage
- Implement more detailed error reporting/recovery
- Consider adding a "simplified mode" that doesn't rely on token counting for lower-power devices

## Known Issues
- WebAssembly loading has been challenging due to VS Code's security model
- Context window size might not update properly during generation in some cases
- Need more error resilience for when tiktoken fails to load
