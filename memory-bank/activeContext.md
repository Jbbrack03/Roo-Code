# Active Context

## Current Focus
We're focusing on making the context window tracking for LM Studio work properly. The implementation we've created needs to properly load WebAssembly files for token counting.

## Recent Changes
- Implemented WebAssembly file loading mechanism that works with VS Code's extension security model
- Fixed the tiktoken module to properly load from extension path
- Added extension context initialization in extension.ts
- Created error resilient loading with fallback character counting when WebAssembly is unavailable
- Fixed loading paths for webview and worker contexts
- Improved error handling for WebAssembly instantiation

## Issues Addressed
- Missing tiktoken_bg.wasm error 
- Worker communication with extension context
- Context window size not updating during model generation
- File permissions on WebAssembly files

## Next Steps
- Test the implementation in a proper VS Code extension environment
- Monitor WebAssembly loading in the developer console
- Validate that context window metrics update correctly during generation
- Consider implementing a more robust error reporting system for the user when WebAssembly fails to load
- Create a simple, non-blocking UI indicator for token counting status
